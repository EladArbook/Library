Library Management Web Application

* This project is an interactive web application designed to streamline library operations. Developed as a volunteering project for a previous role at Orcam.


Key Features:
User Operations: Users can borrow, return, add, and remove books. All actions are logged in the system history for transparency.
Admin Functionality: Admins have control over approving new user registrations, managing book inventory, and blocking users when necessary.
History Tracking: Every action, including borrowing and returning books, is saved for easy tracking by the admin.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: Angular for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Backend: Node.js for handling API requests and business logic.
Database: MySQL for storing user data, books, and transaction histories.

This project showcases my ability to build full-stack applications, working with both front-end and back-end technologies, as well as handling database operations. It demonstrates my skills in creating efficient, user-friendly solutions for real-world problems.
